The best way in order to get the jar filr is use:

$ mvn package


In order to avoid an error message "Invalid signature file digest for Manifest main attributes", we have to remove from the jar file the files:

META-INF/BCKEY.DSA
META-INF/BCKEY.SF

We can exclude these files with "maven-shade-plugin". 

Working with IntelliJ this functionality does not work.

So, we remove the files with one of these commands after the jar file is created:

$ zip -d out/artifacts/jcloudsblobstorecreate_jar/jcloudsblobstorecreate.jar META-INF/*.DSA META-INF/*.SF

$ 7z d -tzip out/artifacts/jcloudsblobstorecreate_jar/jcloudsblobstorecreate.jar META-INF/*.DSA META-INF/*.SF
